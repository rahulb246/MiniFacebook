# MiniFacebook

Concepts Used: Graphs, Trie, File Handling, Command Line Arguments

Description: A console based C Program where some Facebook features are implemented: 
1.take new users and map their friends details 
2.store the users and their friendships(in the file)
3.list out all the friends of a user
4.list out mutual friends of any two friends
5.LINKEDIN feature ‘how you are connected’ (showing the path of connections how two users are connected).

Every feature is implemented very efficiently using the right and effective datastructures. For example, Trie data structure 
is used hold over 1 lakh users so that time required for finding any username will be O(length(username)).
